# Sentiment Analysis for Movie Reviews

**Overview**
This project performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of movie reviews to classify them as either positive or negative. Sentiment analysis helps determine the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in the text, which can be valuable for understanding public opinions about movies.

**Dependencies**
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed to run the project successfully:

Python (>=3.0)
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Matplotlib
You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib

**Data Collection**
The dataset used for this project was obtained from [source_name]. It contains a collection of movie reviews, each labeled as positive or negative sentiment. The dataset is stored in a CSV file format.

**Data Preprocessing**
1. Loading Data: The dataset is loaded from the CSV file using the Pandas library.

2. Sentiment Labeling: Sentiment labels in the dataset are replaced with binary values (1 for positive, 0 for negative).

3. Text Preprocessing: Several preprocessing steps are applied to the text data:

* HTML tags are removed from the text.
* Text is converted to lowercase.
* Special characters are removed.
* Stopwords are removed using NLTK's stopword list.
* Words are stemmed using the Porter Stemmer.

**Feature Extraction**
The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization technique is used to convert the preprocessed text data into numerical features. TF-IDF assigns weights to terms based on their frequency within a document and across the entire dataset.

**Model Training**
A Random Forest classifier from scikit-learn is employed to train the sentiment analysis model on the TF-IDF vectors. This model learns to predict sentiment labels (positive/negative) based on the features extracted from the text data.

**Model Evaluation**
* Model accuracy is calculated as the proportion of correct predictions on the test dataset.
* A confusion matrix is generated to assess the model's performance in classifying positive and negative sentiments.

**Visualization**
A function is provided to visualize the confusion matrix, which helps in understanding the model's performance.

**Usage**
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.
2. Load the dataset into the project.
3. Execute the code, which will preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

**Results**
The model's accuracy on the test dataset is reported as [insert accuracy percentage]. The confusion matrix provides insights into the model's performance in classifying positive and negative sentiments.

**Future Improvements**
Here are some potential areas for future improvements:

* Experiment with different machine learning models to improve accuracy.
* Explore more advanced text preprocessing techniques.
* Conduct hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
* Consider using more extensive datasets for improved generalization.
